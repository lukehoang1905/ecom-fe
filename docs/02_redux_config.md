## Redux configuration

### Redux store configuration

- Reference: [createStore](https://redux.js.org/api/createstore)
- Reference: [compose](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41359312/396324)
- Reference [Provider and connect](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48227189/396324)

* Create `src/redux/store.js`:

  ```javascript
  import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from "redux";
  import { composeWithDevTools } from "redux-devtools-extension";
  import thunk from "redux-thunk";
  import rootReducer from "redux/reducers";

  const initialState = {};
  const store = createStore(
    rootReducer,
    initialState,
    composeWithDevTools(applyMiddleware(thunk))
  );

  export default store;
  ```

* In `src/index.js`:
  ```javascript
  import { Provider } from "react-redux";
  import store from "redux/store";
  ...
  ReactDOM.render(
    <Provider store={store}>
      <App />
    </Provider>,
    document.getElementById("root")
  )
  ```

### The API Service

[axios](https://github.com/axios/axios#request-config) has become undeniably popular among frontend developers. Axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. Axios makes it easy to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints.

We put the axios configuration in `src/redux/api.js`. This config will print out every Request and Response. It also adds `accessToken` to the autorization of the headers, or passes the error message to `react-toastify` automatically.

So all of the connections to the backend API will go through this API service. Think about it like a city water gate which control the directions and contents of the flow.

- Create `src/redux/api.js`

```javascript
import axios from "axios";
import { toast } from "react-toastify";

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_API + "/api",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
});
/**
 * console.log all requests and responses
 */
api.interceptors.request.use(
  (request) => {
    console.log("Starting Request", request);
    return request;
  },
  function (error) {
    console.log("REQUEST ERROR", error);
  }
);

api.interceptors.response.use(
  (response) => {
    console.log("Response:", response);
    if (response.data.data && response.data.data.accessToken) {
      api.defaults.headers.common["authorization"] =
        "Bearer " + response.data.data.accessToken;
    }
    return response;
  },
  function (error) {
    error = error.response.data;
    console.log("RESPONSE ERROR", error);
    let errorMsg = error.message || "";
    if (error.errors && error.errors.message)
      errorMsg = errorMsg + ": " + error.errors.message;
    toast.error(errorMsg);
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);

export default api;
```

### Prepare the constants, actions and reducers

Although there would be several separated store parts of an app, our mail app might only need just one domain in the global store.

- `auth`: stores data of the login flow, e.g. current user info
  login, get the current user, etc.
  get list of messages, get a single message, etc.

To both reduce typing and mistakes, we'll define constants that hold the names of our actions (such as `GET_MESSAGES_REQUEST`) in files. For now, let's just create the files first, and in a future step we'll add the values in. We'll create a new file for each group of actions.

**[domain].constants.js**

- In `src/redux/constants/`, create `auth.constants.js` Let them be empty for now.

  ```
  |- constants/
      |- auth.constants.js

  ```

**[domain].actions.js**

- In `src/redux/actions/`, create `auth.actions.js`:
  ```
  |- actions/
      |- auth.actions.js
  ```
- In `auth.actions.js`:

  ```javascript
  import * as types from "redux/constants/auth.constants";
  import api from "redux/api";
  import { toast } from "react-toastify";

  export const authActions = {};
  ```

  index.js
  **reducer.js**

- In `src/redux/reducers/`, create `auth.reducer.js` and `index.js` (Notice that the filename is `.reducer.js` not `.reducers.js`)

  ```
  |- reducers/
      |- auth.reducer.js

  ```

- In `redux/reducers/auth.reducer.js`:

  ```javascript
  import * as types from "redux/constants/auth.constants";
  const initialState = {
    user: {},
    isAuthenticated: null,
    loading: false,
  };

  const authReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
    const { type, payload } = action;

    switch (type) {
      default:
        return state;
    }
  };

  export default authReducer;
  ```

- In `redux/reducer/index.js`:

  ```javascript
  import { combineReducers } from "redux";
  import authReducer from "./auth.reducer";

  export default combineReducers({
    auth: authReducer,
  });
  ```

### Evaluation

- Now let's install [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en). This is an awesome tool for debugging application's state changes.

- Open Chrome DevTools, click on the tab `Redux`, you should see all of the reducers that you have just created:
